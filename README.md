# A Personal Movie Recommender System using StreamlitðŸŽ¥

## About the Project ðŸŽž

A movie recommender system is a type of algorithmic software that provides personalized recommendations of movies to users based on their viewing history, preferences, and behavior. These systems use various techniques such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid models to predict what movies a user is likely to enjoy and then suggest them accordingly.

Movie recommender systems are commonly used by online streaming platforms and movie rental services to suggest movies to users and enhance their user experience.
